# TU Delft - Report/Thesis Template

This template aims to simplify and improve the (Xe)LaTeX report/thesis template by Delft University of Technology with the following three main design principles:

* **Simplicity First:** A class file that has been reduced by nearly 70% to simplify customization;
* **Effortless:** A careful selection of common packages to get started immediately;
* **Complete:** Ready-to-go when it comes to the document and file structure.

This template works with _pdfLaTeX_, _XeLaTeX_ and _LuaLaTeX_. In order to adhere to the TU Delft house style, either _XeLaTeX_ or _LuaLaTeX_ is required, as it supports TrueType and OpenType fonts. _BibLaTeX_ is used for the bibliography with as backend _biber_. Please visit https://dzwaneveld.github.io/report/ for the full documentation.
